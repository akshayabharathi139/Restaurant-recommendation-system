# Restaurant-recommendation-system

Project Objective
The objective of this project is to design and develop a restaurant recommendation system that provides personalized restaurant suggestions based on user-defined preferences such as cuisine type, price range, and user rating. The system leverages content-based filtering techniques to identify and recommend restaurants that closely align with the user's inputs.

System Implementation Overview
1. Data Preprocessing
Missing Value Handling: All missing entries are addressed using fillna('Unknown') to ensure data completeness and consistency.
Categorical Encoding: Categorical features (e.g., cuisine, location) are encoded into numerical formats to enable processing by machine learning algorithms.
2. Recommendation Criteria Definition
Recommendations are generated based on the following user-defined parameters:

Cuisine Type (e.g., Italian, Indian, Chinese)
Price Range (minimum and maximum cost per meal)
Aggregate Rating (minimum acceptable rating)
3. Content-Based Filtering Methodology
Text Vectorization: Cuisine-related textual data is converted into numerical representations using TF-IDF vectorization.
Feature Normalization: Numerical attributes such as price and ratings are normalized using MinMaxScaler to ensure scale consistency.
Similarity Computation: Cosine similarity is employed to measure the closeness between user preferences and restaurant profiles.
Recommendation Output: The top five restaurants with the highest similarity scores are presented as personalized recommendations.
4. Model Evaluation and Testing
User Scenarios: Sample user inputs are tested to evaluate the system’s recommendation accuracy.
Performance Validation: Various cuisine and budget combinations are used to assess the quality and relevance of suggestions.
Technology Stack
Technology	Purpose
Python	Core programming and scripting
Pandas	Data manipulation and preprocessing
Scikit-learn	Feature engineering and similarity computation
NumPy	Numerical operations and array handling
Streamlit	Interactive front-end web application
Deployment Instructions
1. Required Files
Ensure the following files are present in the project directory:

app.py: Main script to run the application
Dataset.csv: Dataset containing restaurant information
2. File Path Configuration
Update the dataset path in app.py as follows:

file_path = "Dataset.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
3. Environment Setup
Install the necessary Python libraries using the following command:

pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn numpy
4. Application Execution
Launch the application with the command:

streamlit run app.py
This will open a browser-based interface where users can specify their preferences to receive real-time restaurant recommendations.
Proposed Future Enhancements
Integration of deep learning models to improve recommendation accuracy and context awareness
Implementation of collaborative filtering for enhanced personalization based on user behavior
Inclusion of interactive data visualizations to compare restaurant attributes and recommendations
Refinement of the user interface to improve accessibility, responsiveness, and aesthetics
Conclusion
This project demonstrates a practical application of machine learning techniques in the domain of personalized recommendations. By incorporating user preferences and employing robust content-based filtering methods, the system effectively delivers relevant restaurant suggestions, providing a solid foundation for future scalability and enhancement.
